# Machine Calibration

Effort was spent in calibrating the software to spray weeds more effectively. A hinge was added to wand servo mount so that the timing could be changed. It was found that having wand closer to camera was not an improvement. The AI processing and wand response requires the time that thirteen inches of machine travel affords. Herbie should be driven at a slow walk speed, generally. If weeds are sparse, it can go faster, into the green light speed. But if weeds are heavy, it's good to slow down and allow the machine to identify and spray more of the weeds. This is the red light speed, or slow. The average speed is the yellow light, in the middle.

The video link below shows the outcome of pulling weeds and placing them on the concrete driveway at assorted places in the width of the machine, and driving over them. It's apparent that the weeds were sprayed and the aim is good. The flowers at the end of video are just for your eye enjoyment.

Another detail that added to development speed was putting in the five-wire plug-jack in the Raspi GPIO line. This allowed easy removal of the Raspi board to carry it inside to connect it to screen, keyboard and mouse. Each time Raspi was reinstalled in Herbie the precise pins didn't have to be searched out and carefully connected up! This plug required the purchase of a set of terminals and crimper from Amazon. The tool has a neat rachet mechanism but it wasn't expensive.

We are assuming that if you build Herbie you'll find the timing works out well if you follow these general dimensions:

Camera 18 inches high, showing full width of 1080 image

Camera 13 inches before spray wand

Spray wand about 18 inches long and covering ground area about 20 inches wide

Use 15 of the 20 available servo positions, between -1.0 and 1.0

Good luck! and let us know how it works out for you!
